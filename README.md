# SimulinkGitTest
Working through some features of Matlab 
Simulink Project with Git Version Control

Project can be licensed with the included license file.

Here are some contrived examples of Simulink models in .slx format
with a library in the project with blocks used in different model
files. I make an attempt to show how Git can be used by a team to do
distributed work (multiple users on multiple machines) using
Simulink Project, Git/GitHub. I'm also working with the GitHub issue
tracking tool to see how that can be used with Simulink.

I'm using 
Matlab R2015a
Matlab Report Generator toolbox
Simulink Report Generator toolbox

Report generator toolboxes are used to do "diff" operations on .slx
files for merging purposes.
